# Bet program
This program was written to simplify placements of "safe bets".
It worked by scraping internet sites and downloading the current odds at various sites. The only site that was scraped correctly was oddslive webpage. Support for many more sites (ladbrokes, unibet ets) was desired but never implemented fully. Therefore the files inheriting from Sajt (except Oddslive.java) are all not finished with their implementation.
The program was developed in Java and the IDE BlueJ. Therefore a project file for BlueJ is present. The file Betcalc.java is the "main program"
